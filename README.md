I have created a ecommerce app using flutter with firebase which does include three objectives to achive 
1).first i make an user authentications screens whcih does inclue the login ,signup and forgot password screen in this when we try to authenticate the user into home page of the app the enetered data is updating in the backend named firebase the data is keep saving insisde the firebase authentication and firebase firestore.
2)the second objective is to show the data using api models and then maked a responsive ui with best functionality the data of products has been taken from the external api's in which dont need to make the separate table for fetching the data online and did make multiple screens:
a)home screen with bottom navigation bar
b)add to cart screen 
c)wishlist screen
d) search screen
e)settings

In Add to cart screen there is proper product list has been showed up in the grid layout formt and whene ever clcink on any product they would move onto the next pproduct deatils screen where we can like and unlike our products and add them to cart .
In next therere is search functionality pplied there whenever try to search any product with any initial alphabets the relavenet products has been displaying on the screen and the user is ble to see it on different screen ready to like it ,unlike it , add o cart 

Apart from that there is settings functionlity has been applied in ehich user can edit their profile,there phone number and email and the amazing things is this that the data is keeep changing in the backend firebase whether it is crating data,deleting and updating the data.


One more functionality has been tries to add their and user picture in thecircle avatar which include the picture of user name first initial alphabet that has been saved in the firebase.This is the functionality that i tried to add in my project.
